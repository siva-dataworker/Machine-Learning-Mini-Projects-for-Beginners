# 📊 Machine Learning Mini Projects for Beginners

Welcome to **Machine Learning Mini Projects for Beginners** a collection of simple, beginner friendly projects built using  ML algorithms with **toy datasets**.  

⚠️ **Note:** This repository is created **only for beginners** who want to build a strong foundation in machine learning and understand how algorithms work step by step.

Each project is designed to help you understand the **core concept, workflow, and practical implementation** of  ML models — from **loading the data** to **model evaluation**.

## 📦 What's Inside?

This repository covers the most commonly used machine learning algorithms and techniques:

- 📈 **Linear Regression** – Simple and multiple regression examples  
- 🔐 **Logistic Regression** – Binary and multi-class classification projects  
- 🌳 **Decision Tree & Random Forest** – Tree-based models and ensemble learning  
- ⚙️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Margin-based classification techniques  
- 🧠 **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** – Fundamentals of deep learning  
- 🖼️ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** – Basic image classification examples  
- 📅 **Time Series Forecasting** – AR, MA, and ARIMA models

📌 Each algorithm includes **3 mini projects with different toy datasets**, making it easier to practice and compare results across multiple scenarios.
